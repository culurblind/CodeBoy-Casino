To use CodeBoy Casino you need to click on website.py. From there then you can run it and tou will see in the terminal
a link that should say "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000." Once that link is clicked you will see the 3 games as buttons
click on the desired game you want to play and go back to the vs code terminal. In the terminal you can play the game and 
once the game is over go back to the site to see the new balance, and go back to the home screen to select another game.
For the most optimal experiance, we would recomend haveing the vscode terminal side by side with the actual website
